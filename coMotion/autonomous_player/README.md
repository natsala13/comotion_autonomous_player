# New authonomous player library

## Issues
- [x] prm module
- [x] heuristic library
- [x] update prm graph in live according to robots new locations.
- [x] dijkestra partially up to depth t.
- [x] basic heuristic player.
- [x] remove oponent players from graph.
- [ ] Finish at circles
- [ ] Fasten heuristic calculation.
- [ ] Min max.
- [ ] 3 robots moving together.
- [ ] Monte Carlo
- [ ] Profiling.
- [ ] Prm - bridge test.

## Questions
* Make an 8 d prm graph? Including all robots possible locations?
* Why should all robots' paths be the same?
* How can I measure a path and not an end situation? (path eating few candies all at once?)
* When do I worry about end circles?
* Exact scene? is it possible to implement? ni our tests it was always the best one.

## Extra Ideas
* Monte Carlo
* Min max
* Path evaluation instead of end nodes.
